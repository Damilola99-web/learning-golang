## Arrays

In the `arrays` folder, you will find examples and exercises to help you understand and master arrays in Golang.

## Constants

Explore the `constants` folder to dive into the world of constants and how they can enhance your Golang programs.

## Functions

The `functions` folder contains examples that cover a wide range of function-related topics, from basic functions to advanced techniques.

## File Handling

Learn how to work with files in Golang by checking out the `file-handling` folder. Discover best practices and efficient file manipulation techniques.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Explore the principles of Object-Oriented Programming in Golang through the `oop` folder. Master encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in the Go way.

## Maps

The `maps` folder is your guide to understanding Golang maps. Dive into key-value pairs and learn how to leverage maps for efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Loops

In the `loops` folder, grasp the various loop constructs in Golang. From `for` loops to `range` loops, become proficient in controlling program flow.

## Pointers

Uncover the power of pointers in Golang by navigating through the `pointers` folder. Understand how pointers can enhance performance and flexibility in your code.

## Concurrency

Delve into concurrent programming with Golang in the `concurrency` folder. Learn about goroutines, channels, and synchronization to write efficient and concurrent programs.

## Slices

Master the art of working with slices in Golang by exploring the `slices` folder. Understand dynamic arrays and how slices can simplify complex data manipulations.
